_"Defectum"_, Latin for _"failure"_ or _"one with defect"_ is an important word. Its importance stems from the fact that it can universally describe all beings, ever born on this Earth. Simply, the argument is that _"every being"_ has failed at least once in its life. It is fairly trivial to prove this argument - ask anyone the question, _"Did you ever slipped and fell to the ground?"_. The answer will be universally, _"Yes_". Everyone learns to walk through repeated falls. For children, failure to walk, eventually teaches them to walk.  
  
However, the above logic is not entirely free from defects. The argument specifically mentioned _"every being"_ which includes animals and plants, apart from humans. Plants can't be asked a question! and no fish has legs! Thus, not all beings learn to walk by falling and many do not walk at all. The question about falling, therefore, will not prove the argument for _"every being"_.

Though, the argument feels familiar and inherently right. After all, failure feels as ubiquitous as the air we breathe! There must exist some other proof of the argument that can be extend to plants and fishes, otherwise our very instinct can come into question.  

One might call this nitpicking. What even try to prove such a trivial argument? Why not take it for granted? This in fact, is the part of the larger idea. Nothing can be proven to the minutest detail, we can nitpick all the way to find a small defect, in any logic. Even objective mathematical proofs require axioms - statements assumed to be true. It may be said that all axioms are defective as they, by their very nature are unprovable. Moreover, one may even extend, the existence of _"defect"_ as an axiom in itself - _"Defectum est veritas"_ or _"Failure is truth_".

Our society also acknowledges the truth of failure. _"Existence of defect"_ is natural and thus, institutions offer opportunities to correct that defect. A modern graded judicial system is a perfect example of the same. Still, however "failure" comes with a social stigma. An individual who gets labelled as a failure, is often disregarded by the society as unworthy. This dichotomy is strange. On one hand, society provides its members with repeated opportunities to correct failures, but on the other hand, it stigmatizes failure. Maybe, the society wants individuals to avail repeated opportunities. An individual who is labelled as a failure can become an overnight success, if he succeeds on a later opportunity. This provides an impetus for trying again. Without social stigma, people might not try to overcome the failure.

Why must anyone try to overcome failure? Is this not era of individuality where social perceptions of others do not matter? Answer may lie in understanding the social relevance of failure.

Failure, has a connotation of social benchmarks. One who meets those benchmarks is labelled a "success" while the other as "failure". An example could be examination scores, which are considered by the society as a benchmark for educational competence. It is natural that every society wants to develop and various benchmarks can help accelerate this development. For instance, if more and more people achieve the skilling benchmarks, it will be easier for India to reap its demographic dividend. Therefore, for overall social development, individuals must strive to achieve those benchmarks. And, if they any how fail to achieve the same, they must try again, driven by the social stigma of failure.

However, a question arises about the relevance of the "social benchmarks". What if the benchmarks themselves are defected? A popular quote by Einstein raises the same question, _"Everybody is a genius. But, if you judge a fish by its ability climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid"._

Though, societies had the right intentions, their defected benchmarks have resulted in a crisis. Today the benchmarks are so flawed and irrelevant that they are disconnected from goal of social development. Even achieving these benchmarks do not offer competence. Proliferation of competitive examinations in India exemplifies the same, particularly generalist examinations like the Civil Service Examination (CSE) conducted by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC). 

The curriculum is such exams is too subjective. This has resulted in emergence of various cram-schools and coaching institutions. These institutions sell the "dream of success" to the students by spoon-feeding them. This inhibits the natural development of an individual. Cramming over individual development also skews the larger social development goal. Further, this leads to the "rat race" culture in the society, where every fish, bird and mammal tries to climb a tree without even questioning if he wants to the tree.

The benchmarks set by such examinations are designed to be exclusive. These benchmarks are not to boost the general capability of students, rather they are designed to exclusively select few from many. Low success-rate is by intention is such examinations. Such competitive examinations are thus, an exception to the notion of "failure" discussed earlier. Failure in such examinations must not be treated like any other failure, which improves individual capability. Failure must also not be stigmatized, as these examinations are irrelevant to general societal capabilities. Though, success is still to be celebrated as such examinations filter out the future policy-implementors and makers.

PB Shelly once said, _"poets are unacknowledged legislator of the world"_. In fact, many Many poets and prolific writers have written on the topic of _"overcoming failure"_ - emphasizing an unrecognized piece of legislation, that aims for people to _"overcome failure"_.  Edgar Guest in poem _"Don't Quit"_ emphasizes the same,

<p align="center">
<i>
"Success is failure turned inside out - <br>
The silver tint of the clouds of doubt,<br>
<br>
And you never can tell how close you are,<br>
It may be near when it seems afar,<br>
<br>
So stick to the fight when you're hardest hit,-<br>
It's when things seem worst that you must not quit."<br>
</i>

Recognizing that failure is natural part of the universe is the first step in overcoming any failure. Social stigma also provides an impetus to overcome failure. However, the most important factor is "self awareness" of an individual. One must understand his true calling. He must first recognize weather he is a fish or not. Afterwards, he will automatically find, if he is meant to climb a tree or not. 

The idea of a "self awareness" is also linked with "individual agency". People with clear self awareness, often lack individual agency. This can be due to various reasons like social prejudice, and peer pressure. In such a scenario they end up doing what they don't like. They lack enthusiasm, initiative or any motivation to give their hundred percentage. Failure thus becomes an inevitable norm.

While, people who have clear self awareness along with individual agency end up where they are meant to be.  They find their ultimate calling and do what they enjoy. An interesting phenomena is that you don't get tired when you enjoy your work. Such scenario is where one can never fail. Defects and flaws might still pop-up, but they are treated as learning experiences and the failure itself is turned into success.

Ceasing one's individual agency might not be easy. There are challenges beyond one's control. Many barriers to individual agency are institutional and social. However, in modern society with technological proliferation one can eventually find v means to jump over the social and institutional barriers. For instance, a child with an interest in Art can still do online courses on Art, despite studying Engineering under peer pressure. However, getting completely out of the shackles which bound one's individual agency, is the ultimate solution. This requires conviction.

Often, an individuals themselves lack conviction. Their own lack of conviction exacerbates the social and institutional shackles on their agency. There are numerous examples of trailblazers in society that challenged the social norms and broke all kind of prejudices. From Socrates in the ancient time to Rosa Parks in modern times, history in fact is a study of such trailblazers. They give everyone the message that with indomitable individual conviction comes individual agency.

Individual conviction is also an insurance against failures. It is said that if one has true conviction in his goal and if the goal is righteous, the whole universe conspires to enable him to achieve that goal. The best selling novel "Alchemist" by Paulo Coelho shares the same idea. _"Rather than purposelessly trying to overcoming failure just have conviction on your self and you will never fail. All failures are temporary and you truly fail when you loose your conviction"_.  Every failure thus, is a medal to be worn with pride.

The Japanese art of _"Kintsugi"_ is perfect example of how failure makes one beautiful. The term is made of two Japanese words, "_Kin"_  meaning "_Gold"_ and _"Tsugi"_ meaning "_Joinery"_. Thus, Kintsugi means "gold-joinery". It is an ancient art form where broken porcelain utensils and jars were rejoined with with gold sprinkled resin. This reforms the broken piece while adding to its beauty. Similar is the case for us, we can either remain broken with failures or can use our failures as ornaments to refine us. This ingenious idea is linked with our perception. Having the right perception along with conviction are the characteristics of an un-failable person.

_"Defectum"_ or _"one with defect"_ is actually a matter of one's perception. The example of Kintsugi helps understand that what we perceive as _"defective"_ may also be _"beautiful_". Our understanding of failure is a mere perception - _"Defectum est sensus" or_ "_failure is perception"_. The words of the legendary Stioc emperor Marcul Arelius are of importance in this regard - _"... nature's inadvertence has its own beauty"_. This is exactly the maxim that defines the philosophical concept of "_Wabi Sabi",_ loosely translated as _"imperfect imperfection"._

Just like a rock or tree has to adhere to any standards of beauty, we must not impose external standard or benchmarks on us. A rock is a success in itself - so are we. Failure as per one standard may be success according to other. After all, failure is a matter of perception and nature has no standards. Failure is just a present reflection of success, waiting for us in future - _"Defectum est successus"_, or _"Failure is success"._
